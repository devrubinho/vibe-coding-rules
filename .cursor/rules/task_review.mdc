- **Task Review - Verify Completed Tasks:**
  - **FAST FORMAT**: `task-flow: review` → Review all completed tasks
  - When user says "task-flow: review" or "review completed tasks":
    - **READ**: `.task-flow/.internal/tasks.json` and `.task-flow/.internal/status.json`
    - **IDENTIFY**: All tasks/subtasks marked as "done"
    - **VERIFY**: Check if each completed task/subtask is actually implemented
    - **REPORT**: List tasks that are erroneously marked as done
    - **SUGGEST**: Mark incorrectly completed tasks back to "pending" or "in_progress"

- **Review Process:**
  1. Read `.task-flow/.internal/tasks.json` to get all task definitions
  2. Read `.task-flow/.internal/status.json` to get completion status
  3. For each task/subtask marked as "done":
     - Check if the implementation exists in codebase
     - Verify if implementation matches the task requirements
     - Check if tests exist (if required by task)
     - Verify if documentation is updated (if required)
  4. Identify discrepancies:
     - Task marked "done" but code doesn't exist
     - Task marked "done" but implementation incomplete
     - Task marked "done" but tests missing
     - Task marked "done" but requirements not met
  5. Report findings and ask user if they want to correct status

- **Review Report Format:**
  ```
  📋 Task Review Results:
  
  ✅ Correctly Completed:
  - Task 1.2: User authentication (verified)
  - Task 2.1: Database migration (verified)
  
  ⚠️  Erroneously Marked as Done:
  - Task 1.3: API endpoint - Code exists but tests missing
  - Task 2.4: Error handling - Implementation incomplete
  
  Do you want to update status for erroneous tasks? [y/N]
  ```

- **Natural Language Phrases:**
  - **FAST FORMAT**: `task-flow: review` or `task-flow review`
  - "review completed tasks"
  - "verify done tasks"
  - "check if tasks are really done"
  - "review task status"
  - Any variation asking to review/verify completed tasks

- **Example:**
  ```
  User: "task-flow: review"
  
  AI Action:
  1. Read tasks.json and status.json
  2. Find all "done" tasks/subtasks
  3. Verify each one:
     - Check if files exist
     - Check if code matches requirements
     - Check if tests exist
  4. Report findings
  5. Ask if user wants to correct status
  6. If confirmed, update status.json
  ```

- **Integration:**
  - Works with [task_execution.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/task_execution.mdc) workflow
  - Respects [git_control.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/git_control.mdc) - never commit automatically

- **Principle:**
  > **Review completed tasks to ensure quality. Verify that "done" means actually done, not just marked. Help maintain accurate task status.**
